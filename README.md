# Design
This stock simulator will allow users to simulate stock purchases based off the real stock market. 
Users will be able to set how many shares of a specific stock they which to purchase and the price they are purchasing those shares at.
Then users will have access to end of day data which shows the actual value of their investment based off the real stock prices.
